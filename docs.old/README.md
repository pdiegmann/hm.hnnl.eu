# Deprecated Documentation

This directory contains the old documentation files that have been migrated to the new MkDocs-based documentation system in the `docs-src` directory.

These files are kept here temporarily for reference only and will be removed in a future update.

Please use the new documentation system instead:

- Online: Visit our GitHub Pages site (once deployed)
- Local: Run `cd docs-src && mkdocs serve`

See the main README.md for more details.
